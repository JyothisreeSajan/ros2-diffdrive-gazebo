# 🚗 Differential Drive Robot Simulation in ROS 2 with Gazebo  


## 🌟 Overview  
Welcome to the **Differential Drive Robot Simulation** repository! This project provides everything you need to simulate and control a differential drive robot in ROS 2 using Gazebo. Whether you're a robotics enthusiast or developer, this repository is your playground for testing and experimenting with robot kinematics in a simulated environment.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🔧 **Robot Modeling**: Includes detailed URDF/Xacro files for defining robot structure, joints, and sensors.  
- 🛠️ **Gazebo Integration**: Preconfigured for seamless visualization and simulation.  
- 🚀 **ROS 2 Nodes**: Implement differential drive kinematics and basic control.  
- 📂 **Launch Files**: Easy-to-use scripts for starting the simulation with a single command.  
- 🌍 **Example Worlds**: Prebuilt environments to test and refine robot behavior.  

## ⚙️ Requirements  
- 🐢 **ROS 2**: Compatible with [your ROS 2 distro, e.g., Humble, Foxy].  
- 🛠️ **Gazebo**: Recommended version [e.g., Gazebo Fortress or Classic].  
- 🐍 **Python**: Version 3.x for running scripts and nodes.  

## 🛠️ Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
